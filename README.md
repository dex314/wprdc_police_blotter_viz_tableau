# wprdc_police_blotter_viz_tableau
A Tableau visualization based on WPRDC Pittsburgh Police Blotter data sets with some aggregations performed in a Python notebook.
Hopefully this is a working notebook where I can find time to make more updates and expand.

The jupyter notebook connects to WPRDC data by URL and is located in this repo.

You can find the original data here:
